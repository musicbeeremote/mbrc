/**
 * Holds commands that could not be written to the socket so they can be replayed once the
 * connection is restored.
 *
 * Three rules keep a replay from surprising the user:
 * - **Bounded lifetime.** A command older than [ttlMs] is dropped instead of replayed. The age is
 *   measured from the moment the user issued it, so a command that keeps failing on a flapping
 *   connection eventually ages out instead of being refreshed forever.
 * - **Collapsing of value-setting commands.** Contexts in [LAST_WRITE_WINS] describe a value rather
 *   than an event, so only the newest matters: a volume drag replays the final level, and repeated
 *   play/pause taps replay as a single toggle. Event commands such as `next` are never collapsed,
 *   because two of them mean the user asked for two things.
 * - **Only player commands are replayed at all.** [REPLAYABLE] is an allow-list: handshake and
 *   keep-alive traffic belongs to the socket it was queued for, and anything addressed at a queue
 *   position or at whatever is currently playing would land somewhere else by the time it replays.
 *
 * Buffering a command is silent: the connection indicator already tells the user they are offline,
 * and the command is still expected to happen. Discarding one is not, because that is the only
 * point at which a tap is lost with nothing else to signal it, so [onDiscarded] is invoked with the
 * number of commands given up on.
