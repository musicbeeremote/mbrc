/**
 * Generates a baseline profile for the app.
 *
 * Run this test on a device with API 28+ (rooted or userdebug build recommended for best results).
 *
 * To generate the profile:
 * ```
 * ./gradlew :app:generateBaselineProfile
 * ```
 *
 * The generated profile will be placed in `app/src/main/generated/baselineProfiles/`.
 *
 * The journey covers the screens the app is actually used on, not just its launch. A profile
 * recorded from a cold start alone leaves the queue, the library and the player uncompiled, which
 * is where the scrolling happens.
 *
 * The lists are seeded first. Profiles are captured against the release application id, which has
 * never reached a plugin, so without seeding every list here records its empty state.
