## Application development status
**As of January 2023 the application is now unpublished from Play Store and considered unmaintained.** For the majority of 2022 I didn't have the energy or time to continue with the development and support of the application. I might still answer support e-mails and you can still use the available builds but the application will be as it is.

## About the Project

[![MusicBee Remote Screenshot][project-screenshot]](https://mbrc.kelsos.net)

MusicBee Remote is an application that allows you to control [MusicBee](http://getmusicbee.com/) player.
This is achieved by using a [plugin](https://github.com/kelsos/mbrc-plugin) that acts as a server.
The plugin exposes a TCP socket server and uses a JSON based protocol to communicate with the Android application.

The application development started in 2011 for personal usage and then it was open sourced and released to Play Store so others could use it. The application was also presented as part of my thesis title "*Android and application development for mobile devices*".

### Built With

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)

## Getting Started

In order to get started with the project as a developer there are a few steps you need to follow.

### Prerequisites

Android Studio should be installed on your local machine and it should be up to date.

During development the Canary version of the Android Studio is used, but for release versions the stable version of AGP is always preferred.

To get started with the the project you first have to clone the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/musicbeeremote/android-app.git
```

Then you can open the project with Android Studio.

### Installation

There is a number of ways you could install the application on your device. If you are a developer you can run install on Android Studio and that should take care of the installation.

Alternatively you could download a stable version of the Remote from [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kelsos.mbrc).

The Play Store version of the remote include FireBase and Crashlytics and collects anonymous analytics.

Alternatively there is a GitHub version on the [releases](https://github.com/musicbeeremote/android-app/releases) page that doesn't include any Crash or analytics reporting for people that are cautious about their privacy.

## Usage

In order to use the application you need a working WiFi connection, that doesn't have [access point isolation](https://www.howtogeek.com/179089/lock-down-your-wi-fi-network-with-your-routers-wireless-isolation-option/).

You have to first install the [plugin](https://github.com/musicbeeremote/android-app/releases).

After installing the plugin if you are not prompted to allow MusicBee or the plugin through the Windows Firewall you might have to manually configure Windows Firewall to allow the plugin to receive connections.

For more detailed information you can check the [help](https://mbrc.kelsos.net/help/) page.
